    `I really like the clean design and the color scheme feels modern.
10 Credits - Specific Feedback:
The fire icon in the top right is a bit confusing - I wasn't sure if it meant notifications or something else. Adding a tooltip would help clarify its purpose.`,
    `15 Credits - Actionable Feedback:
The chat interface could benefit from keyboard shortcuts for power users. For example, Cmd+K to focus the search, Cmd+N for new thread, and Cmd+Enter to send messages would significantly improve the workflow.`,
    //     `20 Credits - Exceptional Feedback:
    //     The onboarding flow has a few UX issues I noticed:

    //     1. The "Get Started" button on the landing page doesn't clearly indicate what happens next - consider changing it to "Create Your First Agent" to set expectations.
    //     2. When uploading files, there's no progress indicator, which made me think the app froze during a large upload. Adding a progress bar with file size/upload speed would reduce anxiety.`,
    //     `20 Credits - Exceptional Feedback:
    //     3. The empty state in the chat could be more engaging - instead of just showing tips, consider adding quick-start templates like "Plan a trip", "Analyze data", etc. that users can click to see example interactions.
    //     4. The credit system isn't explained anywhere visible. New users might not understand why their messages stop working. A small "?" icon next to the credit counter with a tooltip explaining the system would help.
    //        These changes would significantly reduce friction for new users and improve retention.`,
